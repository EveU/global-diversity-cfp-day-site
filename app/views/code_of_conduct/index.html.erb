<h2>Issue Log</h2>
<h3>September 2018</h3>
<p>
  Having received a number of reports about the inappropriate behaviour of two workshop organisers, outside of Global Diversity CFP Day, they have been banned from participating in any future Global Diversity CFP Day events.
</p>
<p>
  Our workshop organisers are expected to be role models for attendees. Given they are in charge of attendee safety, organisers are held to the highest standard.
</p>
<p>
  We take your safety and trust very seriously.
</p>
<p>
  Our aim is to cultivate a positive, inclusive environment and it is our responsibility to maintain this environment for everyone.
</p>
